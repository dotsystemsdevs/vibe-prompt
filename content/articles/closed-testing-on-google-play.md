Google Play has a rule that catches most first-time Android shippers off guard: before your app can reach production, it needs to run in closed testing with real users for 14 continuous days. Not friends adding the test track and forgetting about it. Real users actually opening the app.

The official guidance is "find some testers." That's about it. What you actually need is a recruitment strategy, because the difference between hitting 100 testers in two weeks and giving up at 12 is mostly knowing where to post and what to ignore.

This is the playbook from shipping multiple apps through this process.

## What done looks like

Before you even open the Play Console, the bar is:

- The app works. Not perfect, just doesn't crash on the main flow.
- Play Store screenshots are ready (Figma is fine for this).
- The signed AAB is built and uploaded.
- A closed testing group exists in the Play Console with a join link.

The targets you're shooting for:

- **30+ active members minimum,** ideally 100+ before submitting for production review.
- **About two weeks** of timeline, before you start your next major update.

Below 30, Google's review team will sometimes push back. Above 100, you're past the diminishing-returns point.

## What to call the app

This sounds trivial. It isn't. The name you pick changes who's willing to test it.

Two real renames that materially changed recruiting traction:

| Before | After | Why it worked better |
|---|---|---|
| `my-tracker` | `Win/Loss Tracker` | Specific, neutral, broader appeal |
| `Lost Ball Counter` | `The Real Scorecard` | Less weird, more professional |

The pattern: neutral, descriptive names get more testers than internal codenames or jokes. People scrolling a recruitment thread make a snap judgment from the name alone.

## Where to recruit (and where not to)

Almost all of the recruiting effort goes into channels that actually convert. Here's the data from running this process repeatedly:

**What actually works:**

- **r/AndroidClosedTesting.** Best single channel. Start here. People are actively looking for apps to test in exchange for theirs. Post once with a clear call to action and turn on notifications.
- **Niche forums for your app's category.** Golf forums for a golf app. Personal finance subreddits for a money app. These convert better than the generic test channels because they validate demand at the same time.
- **Reddit "test for test" threads.** Works if you reply within minutes. Slow replies miss the window.

**What does not work, despite seeming like it should:**

- **Discord servers.** Posted in five large dev/indie Discords across multiple weeks. Total testers from all of them combined: one.
- **Telegram groups.** Zero response across multiple posts.
- **Reddit UX/UI subreddits.** Got banned in two of them and roasted in a third. They're not for recruitment, they're for design critique.

The lesson: go where people are explicitly looking to install and test apps, or where your specific user lives. Generic developer hangouts don't convert.

## The recruiting strategy that hits 100

The mechanics that work:

1. Post in r/AndroidClosedTesting with a clear title, the link to join, and a one-line description of the app.
2. Turn on Reddit notifications so you reply fast.
3. Reply immediately to every "test for test" comment. Slow replies kill the swap.
4. Be active during US waking hours, that's where most testers come from.
5. Send roughly 15 personal messages per day. Not more, the algorithm flags you and the people you're DMing get fatigued.
6. Schedule your Reddit time. Trying to do this 24/7 burns you out by day 4.

A real growth curve from this exact process:

| Day | Generic app | Niche-community app |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 25 | 28 |
| 2 | 40 | 44 |
| 3 | 57 | 67 |
| 6 | ~90 | 130 |
| 12 | 110 | shipped |

Notice: the niche-community app grew faster because the community both validated demand and gave better feedback. If you can identify a real community for your app, post there before the generic channels.

## What to expect after day 3

Three patterns surface every time:

**The drop-off.** After day 3-4, daily new testers slow significantly. This is normal. You don't need to keep grinding the same channels; you can ease off without losing momentum.

**Tester churn after 14 days.** Almost everyone goes inactive once their commitment is fulfilled. Plan to keep recruiting at a low rate to backfill.

**Test-for-test reciprocation.** If you ask people to test your app, you owe them the same. Budget about an hour a day for testing other apps. If you skip this, your reputation in those subreddits dies fast and you stop getting swap offers.

## Handling the feedback that comes back

The temptation when feedback starts arriving is to fix everything immediately. Don't. The first batch of feedback always overrepresents whoever shouted loudest, not what's actually wrong with the product.

The discipline that works: collect, don't react.

1. Screenshot every piece of feedback the moment it lands. Save to `docs/screenshots/YYYY-MM-DD-area-desc.png`.
2. Log it in a backlog file with a link to the screenshot.
3. Tag with priority: P1 (must fix), P2 (should fix), P3 (can wait).
4. Wait roughly a week before deciding what to act on.

The reason for the wait: distance produces better decisions. Feedback that felt urgent on the day it arrived is half-forgotten a week later because nobody else mentioned it. Patterns surface only when you let multiple data points accumulate.

The patch cycle that works: pick 3-5 backlog items per release, ship those, repeat. Not "fix everything now." Three items, shipped. Then the next three.

A backlog without evidence (a screenshot or a quote) doesn't go in the queue. This single rule kills 80% of impulse fixes that come from your own anxiety rather than from a real user signal.

## The mistake to avoid

Updated immediately after every piece of feedback in the first apps shipped this way. The result: a chaotic week of impulsive fixes, two of which had to be reverted, and a sense that the app was never "done."

Switching to a one-week cooling period made the patch cycle sustainable. Same feedback, same fixes, but planned and bundled instead of reactive.

If you're shipping your first Android app, this is the single habit worth installing before anything else: collect feedback like data, not like alarm bells.
