Most launch advice ends at the launch itself. Here's the part nobody writes about: the weeks after, when you check the dashboard, the numbers haven't moved, and you don't know which lever to pull next.

This article is the troubleshooting guide. Five real problems that surface after launch, what we tried for each one across multiple apps, and which interventions actually changed the metric. Everything below is from shipped apps, not from frameworks.

If you're stuck in the post-launch dead zone, this is the playbook.

## Problem 1: Daily active users keep dropping

The most common post-launch shape: a spike at launch, then a steady decline as the early curiosity wears off.

| Action | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Push notifications, staggered (8h → 24h → 72h → 7d) | First measurable uptick after weeks of decline | **Ship before launch** |
| In-app review prompt after N sessions | Brings users back, generates reviews as a side effect | **Ship before launch** |
| Daily streaks / engagement hooks | DAU dropped, users felt punished for missing days | **Only for daily-use apps** |

The takeaway: not every app is a daily-use app. If your users come when they have something specific to do (log a round, track a transaction, check a result), notifications work because they're useful reminders. Streaks fail because they impose a daily-use pattern on apps that aren't daily-use products.

The mistake is borrowing engagement mechanics from Duolingo when your app is actually closer to a tax calculator. Match the mechanic to the use case.

The single highest-impact intervention: push notifications, configured at launch, not bolted on a month later. By the time you notice DAU dropping, you've already lost most of the users you'd have notified.

## Problem 2: Store visitors aren't installing

Store conversion (visit-to-install rate) is the most fixable post-launch metric, and the one most people ignore because it requires re-doing screenshots.

| Action | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Screenshots showing the app with real data | 76% conversion | **Do this first** |
| Screenshots showing empty states | 43% conversion | **Never ship this** |
| ASO keyword optimization | Marginal, niche apps get near-zero search traffic | **Worth doing, don't expect magic** |
| Benefit-first short description | Modest improvement | **Always test it** |

The single highest-impact lever: screenshots showing the app full of realistic-looking content. Not empty states. Not lorem ipsum. Real-shaped data: actual scores, real entries, populated dashboards.

The data above is the same app, with the same listing copy. Just the screenshots different. The difference between 76% and 43% conversion is more than 70% more installs from the same traffic.

If your app is launched and conversion feels low, fix the screenshots before changing anything else. Use Figma, mock the screens with realistic data, screenshot those mocks. Most users won't notice they're polished mockups; they'll notice the app looks lived-in.

## Problem 3: Zero discovery from organic channels

Indie devs assume their app will get found in the Play Store. For niche apps, that almost never happens.

| Action | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| ASO keyword optimization | 0-2 installs from search across all apps | **Niche apps get ~0 search** |
| Instagram reels (share-CTA format) | 80-94% non-follower reach, 0 confirmed installs | **Builds followers, not installs** |
| Instagram carousels | 0 engagement | **Dead format for app marketing** |
| Google Play Explore | ~10 organic installs over 90 days | **Happens passively, can't force** |

The takeaway: if your app is niche, 90%+ of installs come from links you share yourself. Instagram is an awareness channel. Search is a rounding error. Play Explore happens passively when it does.

The acquisition channel that actually works: community posts in places where your users already hang out. Subreddits for the specific niche, Facebook groups, niche forums. A single post in a community that fits your app converts better than a month of ASO tweaks.

The mental model shift: stop looking for distribution channels and start looking for communities. The community you can describe in one sentence ("freelance designers who manage 3-5 client projects") is probably reachable. Generic discovery is not.

## Problem 4: Need reviews fast

The first ten reviews matter more than the next hundred. Here's what actually delivers them.

| Action | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Personal DMs to past testers | High response rate, fast conversion | **Best method** |
| DM swaps with other indie devs | Reviews + networking, both useful | **Great ROI** |
| Email to closed testing group | Some responses, slow | **OK supplement** |
| Mass messages in Discord / dev groups | Effectively nothing | **Waste of time** |
| In-app review prompt | Steady trickle over time | **Set and forget** |

A real result: 16 reviews in a single day. 100% from personal one-on-one messages. 0% from any mass message in any group.

The pattern: relationships beat reach for reviews. The DM that says "hey, I noticed you tested my app, would you have a minute to leave a review?" converts dramatically better than any post or broadcast.

This is also the channel almost everyone skips because it feels manual. It is manual. That's why it works. The channels that scale infinitely (mass posts, group blasts) convert near zero. The channel that's one-message-at-a-time converts.

For the first ten reviews, send the DMs. After that, the in-app prompt does the rest passively.

## Problem 5: Instagram followers, no installs

The most common confusing pattern: the Instagram account is growing, the engagement on posts is real, the install number isn't moving.

| Action | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Share-CTA reels ("send this to someone who...") | Best reach (80-94% non-followers) | **Good for follower growth** |
| Humor reels | Best engagement (loop rate, saves) | **Good for retention** |
| Tips / educational content | Decent engagement | **OK for credibility** |
| Carousels | 0 engagement | **Don't bother** |
| Bio link to app store | 0 confirmed installs | **Nobody clicks through** |

The hard data: 1,000+ Instagram followers gained in the first weeks of posting. Confirmed installs from that channel: zero.

The takeaway: Instagram grows your brand and your audience. It does not grow your install base. Trying to use it for installs misuses the channel.

What Instagram is actually good for:

1. Brand awareness in your niche, real signal that compounds over time.
2. Inbound DMs from people interested in what you're building.
3. Audience for future products and content.

What Instagram is bad for: direct app installs in the next 30 days. Use community posts in subreddits and niche forums for that. Use Instagram for the long game.

## The pattern across all five problems

Notice what shows up in every single table: the high-impact interventions are usually low-effort and counter to common advice.

- **Push notifications, not gamification.**
- **Realistic screenshots, not ASO.**
- **Community posts, not channel diversification.**
- **Personal DMs, not group blasts.**
- **Single channel match, not channel maximization.**

The common indie-marketing advice is to do everything: ASO, social, ads, content, community, partnerships. The data says do less, but pick what fits the actual product and audience.

The other pattern: most of the highest-leverage things should have been done at launch, not after. Push notifications, polished screenshots, a clear community to post in. Bolting these on after you've noticed the metric dropping costs more than installing them on day one.

## What to do if you're stuck

The triage order, from highest to lowest leverage:

1. **Fix the screenshots.** If they show empty states, replace them with realistic data this week. Conversion will move.
2. **Add push notifications.** If the app doesn't have them, add them now, even if launch was months ago. DAU will move.
3. **Do the personal-DM round for reviews.** One morning of DMs in r/googleplayconsole gets you to ten reviews. Conversion improves.
4. **Find the one community where your users already are.** Post a real story there, not a launch announcement. Acquisition starts.
5. **Stop expecting Instagram to deliver installs.** Reframe it as audience-building. Energy goes back into the channels that actually work.

If you've done all five and the metrics still aren't moving, the problem isn't marketing. It's the product. Time to look at the second-day retention curve and figure out why people aren't coming back.

That's a different article.
