## Problem
2-3 sentences on the pain point.

## Solution
What you're building and why it's the right approach.

## Target User
Who specifically. Include a one-line persona.

## MVP Scope (what's IN)
Bullet list — max 5 items.

## Out of Scope (what's NOT in MVP)
Bullet list — what you're explicitly not building yet.

## Success Metrics
3 metrics that tell you if it's working.

## Open Questions
2-3 things you still need to figure out.

Keep the whole thing under 400 words.`,
    outputExample: `## Problem
Builders collect great prompts in notes, chats, and bookmarks — and then can't find them when they need them. There's no structured, searchable place built for the builder workflow.

## Solution
An open, GitHub-powered prompt library where builders browse, save, and contribute prompts. The personal library feature turns a directory into a tool you actually come back to.

## Target User
Indie hackers and vibe coders who ship apps using AI tools. Persona: "Alex, building her 3rd app, keeps rewriting the same prompts from scratch."

## MVP Scope
- Browse prompts by category
- Individual prompt pages with copy button
- Save to personal library (requires login)
- Upvote prompts
- Contribute via GitHub PR

## Out of Scope
- Comments (v2)
- AI-powered search (v2)
- Teams/sharing (v3)

## Success Metrics
1. 100 prompts saved to libraries in first month
2. 20% return visit rate week 2
3. 10 community PRs submitted

## Open Questions
- Do we need auth for browsing, or just for saving?
- GitHub PR flow vs. submission form — which gets more contributions?`,

Follow REST conventions:
- Use nouns, not verbs in paths
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH)
- Consistent response shape: { data, error, meta }
- Plural resource names`,
