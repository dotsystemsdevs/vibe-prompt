title: Tech Stack Decision Doc
---

## When to use
Before writing any code, to lock all technology decisions in writing so your AI coding agent never has to guess or make stack decisions independently.

## Prompt

```
Generate a TechDesign.md document for my project. Every decision must be made , no TBD, no "we'll decide later." This document will be committed to the repo and read by the AI coding agent at the start of every session. Ambiguous decisions create inconsistent code.

Project name: [PROJECT NAME]
What it does: [ONE SENTENCE]
Target users: [WHO USES IT]
Expected scale at launch: [e.g. <1000 users, <100 requests/minute]
My constraints: [e.g. must use Vercel free tier, must use Postgres, no paid auth services]

Generate TechDesign.md with these exact sections. For each decision, state the choice AND the reason it was chosen over the main alternative:

## Frontend
- Framework: [Decision + version + reason]
- UI Component Library: [Decision + version + reason, or "none , using Tailwind only"]
- Styling: [e.g. Tailwind CSS 3.4.x , reason]
- State management: [e.g. React state + URL params only , reason, or specific library]
- Form handling: [e.g. React Hook Form 7.x , reason]
- Data fetching: [e.g. Server Components + fetch , reason, or SWR/React Query]

## Backend
- Runtime: [e.g. Next.js API Routes / Edge Functions / Node.js , reason]
- API style: [e.g. REST with Next.js route handlers , reason]
- ORM: [e.g. Drizzle ORM 0.30.x , reason, or Prisma, or raw SQL]

## Database
- Database: [e.g. Postgres via Supabase , reason]
- Schema management: [e.g. Drizzle migrations , reason]
- Connection pooling: [e.g. Supabase pooler , reason, or none needed at this scale]

## Auth
- Provider: [e.g. Clerk , reason, or NextAuth, Supabase Auth]
- Session strategy: [e.g. JWT via Clerk , what this means for API calls]
- Protected routes: [e.g. middleware.ts handles all route protection]

## File Storage (if needed)
- Provider: [e.g. Supabase Storage , reason, or Cloudflare R2, or not applicable]

## Deployment
- Hosting: [e.g. Vercel , reason]
- CI/CD: [e.g. Vercel GitHub integration , auto-deploys on push to main]
- Environment management: [e.g. Vercel env vars for prod, .env.local for dev]

## Observability
- Error tracking: [e.g. Sentry free tier , reason]
- Analytics: [e.g. PostHog free tier , reason, or not implemented at MVP]
- Logging: [e.g. console only at MVP, structured logging in V2]

## Dependency Versions (pinned)
List all key packages with their exact pinned versions. No ^ or ~ ranges.

## Decisions That Are Explicitly OFF The Table
List 3-5 technologies that might seem reasonable but are explicitly not being used, and why. This prevents the AI from suggesting them.

After generating the document, flag any section where my constraints conflict with each other or where my stated scale doesn't match my tech choices.
